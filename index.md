### 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

This quarter, the most interesting topic for me has been causal discovery in biomedical applications. I found it interesting to learn about how causality can help uncover deeper insights about complex real-world systems, such as the human microbiome. Unlike traditional research methods, causal discovery allows us to see potential cause-and-effect relationships, which can be crucial for fields like medicine. These discoveries can lead to better treatment options in medicine.

### 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate causal relationships between specific microbial genera and health conditions, such as insulin resistance. Building on our current dataset from the Stanford T2D Gut Microbiome project, I would like to explore potential causal pathways that differentiate healthy and insulin-resistant individuals. Additionally, it would be interesting to compare how these causal relationships differ across diverse patient demographics, which could provide insights into personalized health recommendations.

### 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

One change I would make to our current approach is to focus on a subset of genera in our data, since the full graph is currently quite messy and complex. By narrowing down the analysis to a smaller subset, we could gain a better understanding and reduce noise. Additionally, we are expecting an updated version of the PC algorithm from Professor Biwei, which will allow us to restrict the number of conditioning variables. With this new version, we could potentially improve the reliability of our causal graph by limiting the conditioning set size and reducing incorrect connections.

### 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I am particularly interested in exploring causal discovery algorithms like LiNGAM in addition to GFCI, GES, Fast-KCI, and FCI methods we have already used. I think this method could potentially help identify more complex causal structures that might be present in the microbiome data. I would also like to potentially explore machine learning techniques that incorporate causality, such as causal representation learning and causal graph neural networks.
